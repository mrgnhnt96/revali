# Overview

## What is Revali?

Revali is a powerful code generator specifically designed for the Dart programming language. It leverages annotations within your classes, methods, and method parameters to create an API, allowing developers to focus on writing clean, maintainable code while it handles the boilerplate.

## How does it work?

Revali analyzes your Dart classes, methods, and annotations to generate code provided by "constructs". These constructs are standalone dart packages that are imported into your project, picked up by Revali, and used to generate code. This allows you to easily extend Revali's capabilities by creating your own constructs or using constructs created by the community.
