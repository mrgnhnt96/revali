# Getting Started

## Installation

### Dependencies

First, you need to add `revali_router` to your project dependencies. Open your `pubspec.yaml` and include the following line in the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
    revali_router: <latest version>
```

Replace `<latest version>` with the actual latest version found on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

### Development Dependencies

Next, add `revali` and `revali_server` to your `dev_dependencies` in the `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
    revali: <latest version>
    revali_server: <latest version>
```

Again, replace `<latest version>` with the actual latest versions available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

### Installing Packages

Run the following command to get the packages:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

With the dependencies installed, you are now ready to set up your application using Revali.
