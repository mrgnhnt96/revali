# Get It

[`get_it`][get-it] is a package that allows you to register and retrieve instances of objects. It's a very popular package in the Dart ecosystem and is a great way to manage dependencies.

## Configure

To use the `get_it` integration, you need to set the `integrations` option to `get_it: true` in the `revali.yaml` file.

```yaml title="revali.yaml"
constructs:
  - name: revali_client
    options:
      integrations:
        get_it: true
```

## Usage

The `get_it` integration will add a `register` method to the client. This method will register the all the services generated by Revali Client.

```dart
final getIt = GetIt.instance;

Server().register(getIt);
```

:::important
The services registered by Revali Client are registered as lazy singletons as their **interface** type.
