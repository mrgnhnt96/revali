# Configure

## Revali Client

Revali Client is configured using the `revali.yaml` file. This file is located in the root of your Revali project.

The content could be as follows:

```yaml title="revali.yaml"
constructs:
  - name: revali_client
    options:
      # ...
```

The `options` section is used to configure the Revali Client.

### `package_name`

The package that is generated by Revali Client Gen can be renamed by setting the `package_name` option. The default value is `client`.

```yaml title="revali.yaml"
constructs:
  - name: revali_client
    options:
      package_name: my_client
```

### `integrations`

The `integrations` option is used to enable or disable integrations. The integrations are:

- `get_it`: Leverage the [`get_it`][get-it] package to register the client. Setting this to `true` will add `get_it` as a dependency and create a `register` method in the client. You can learn more about it [here][get-it-integration].

```yaml title="revali.yaml"
constructs:
  - name: revali_client
    options:
      integrations:
        get_it: true
```

### `scheme`

The `scheme` option is used to construct the base URL in the client to make requests to the server. The default value is `http`.

```yaml title="revali.yaml"
constructs:
  - name: revali_client
    options:
      scheme: https
```

### Exclusion

Occasionally, you may want to exclude a controller or method from being generated in the client. You can do this by using the `ExcludeFromClient` annotation.

```dart
@ExcludeFromClient()
@Controller('user')
class UserController {
  // ...
}
```

```dart
@ExcludeFromClient()
@Get('user')
Future<User> getUser() async {
  // ...
}
```
