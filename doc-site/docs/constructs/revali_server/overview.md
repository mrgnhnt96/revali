# Revali Server

Revali Server is a "[Server Construct][server-construct]" that generates server-side code for Revali applications. It provides a way to define routes, middleware, and other server-side logic in a type-safe way. Inspired by NestJS, Revali Server uses annotations to define routes, middleware, guards and other server-side logic.

:::important
You can only use one Server Construct in your project. If you're using Revali Server, you cannot use any other Server Construct.
