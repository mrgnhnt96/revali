# Web Sockets

Web Sockets are a protocol that allows for full-duplex communication between a client and a server. This means that the client and server can send messages to each other at any time, without having to wait for a response. This is in contrast to the traditional HTTP protocol, which is half-duplex and requires the client to send a request to the server, and then wait for a response.
