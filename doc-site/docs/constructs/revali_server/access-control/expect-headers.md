# Expect Headers

Similar to [Allow Headers][allow-headers], you can specify which headers the server expects in a request. The server will reject any request that does not contain the expected headers. The server will **not** reject a request if the request contains additional headers that are not specified in `@ExpectHeaders`.

## Registering Expect Headers

To register Expect Headers in Revali, use the `@ExpectHeaders` annotation.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to register Expect Headers in Revali:

```dart
import 'package:revali_router/revali_router.dart';

@ExpectHeaders({'X-My-Header'})
@App()
class MyApp ...
```

:::tip
Similar to Lifecycle Components, `@ExpectHeaders` can be scoped to apps, controllers, and requests. Learn about [scoping].

## Preflight Requests

A preflight request is a CORS mechanism that checks if a client is allowed to make a request to a server. This request is sent before the actual request and includes the `OPTIONS` method. The server responds with the allowed headers, methods, and origins.

Revali automatically handles preflight requests.

### Failed Preflight Requests

If a preflight request fails, the server will respond with a `403 Forbidden` status code with limited information.

### Successful Preflight Requests

If a preflight request is successful, the server will respond with the allowed headers, methods, and origins.
