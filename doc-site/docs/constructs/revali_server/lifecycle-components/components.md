# Components

Similar to creating a controller and endpoints using a class and methods, you can create lifecycle components. By using a class, you can group related lifecycle components together and reuse them across different controllers/endpoints.

Components are short-lived classes. They are created when the server is executing a particular piece of middleware, and they are destroyed when the middleware is done executing. New instances of the component are created for each request.

:::warning
You may be tempted to "share" data between method calls by storing it in a component. Not only is this **NOT recommended**, but it is very likely to cause **bugs** üêõ in your application.
:::

## Group Lifecycle Components

To create a group of lifecycle components, create a class that implements the `LifecycleComponent` class.

```dart title="lib/components/my_component.dart"
class MyComponent implements LifecycleComponent {
  const MyComponent();
}
```

You may add fields to this class as you need, such as classes from your [dependencies][di] or values that are specific to the component. You can use [binding annotations][binding] to inject these dependencies into the component.

```dart title="lib/components/my_component.dart"
import 'package:revali_router/revali_router.dart';

class MyComponent implements LifecycleComponent {
  const MyComponent(
    this.myService, {
        @Data() required this.role,
    });

  final MyService myService;
  final Role role;
}
```

:::note
The `@Dep` annotation (used to retrieve data from your [dependencies][di]) is assumed for parameters in the constructor of a `LifecycleComponent`. This means that you do not need to add the `@Dep` annotation. All other annotations, such as `@Data`, etc. must be added to the constructor parameters.

## Define a Lifecycle Component

Now that you have a class to group your lifecycle components, you can create a lifecycle component by adding methods to the class. The method's return type is what determines which lifecycle component it associated with.

| Return Type                        | Lifecycle Type                          | `Future` Support |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `GuardResult`                      | [Guard][guard]                          | ‚úÖ               |
| `MiddlewareResult`                 | [Middleware][middleware]                | ‚úÖ               |
| `InterceptorPreResult`             | [Interceptor (pre)][interceptor-pre]    | ‚úÖ               |
| `InterceptorPostResult`            | [Interceptor (post)][interceptor-post]  | ‚úÖ               |
| `ExceptionCatcherResult<Exception>`| [Exception Catcher][exception-catcher]  | ‚ùå               |

```dart title="lib/components/my_component.dart"
class MyComponent implements LifecycleComponent {
  const MyComponent();

   GuardResult getAuth() {
    // Perform authentication logic
  }

  Future<MiddlewareResult> getRole() async {
    // Get role logic
  }

  Future<GuardResult> verifyRole() async {
    // Perform role verification logic
  }
}
```

:::tip
You can define as many lifecycle components as you need in a single class.
:::

### Binding

Similar in endpoints, you can [bind][binding] values to the parameters of the lifecycle component methods. Values such as the request, context, dependencies, or other lifecycle components.

```dart title="lib/components/my_component.dart"
class MyComponent implements LifecycleComponent {
  const MyComponent();

  GuardResult getAuth(@Body() Map<String, dynamic> body) {
    // Perform authentication logic
  }

  Future<GuardResult> verifyRole(@Param('id', UserPipe) User user) async {
    // Perform role verification logic
  }
}
```

### Context

Each Lifecycle Component has certain access to the request & response context. Review the following context objects that are available to each Lifecycle Component:

| Lifecycle Type                          | Context                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Guard][guard]                          | [Guard Context][guard-context]     |
| [Middleware][middleware]                | [Middleware Context][middleware-context]     |
| [Interceptor (pre)][interceptor-pre]    | [Interceptor Pre Context][interceptor-pre-context]     |
| [Interceptor (post)][interceptor-post]  | [Interceptor Post Context][interceptor-post-context]     |
| [Exception Catcher][exception-catcher]  | [Exception Catcher Context][exception-catcher-context]     |

Each field within the context objects can be [bound implicitly][implied-binding], so you don't need to add an annotation to bind the value to the parameter.

```dart title="lib/components/my_component.dart"
class MyComponent implements LifecycleComponent {
  const MyComponent();

  GuardResult getAuth(ReadOnlyDataHandler dataHandler) {
    // Perform authentication logic
  }

  Future<GuardResult> verifyRole(WriteOnlyDataHandler dataHandler) async {
    // Perform role verification logic
  }
}
```

In addition to the [base implied bindings][binding], here's a comprehensive list of the implicit bindings available:

| Implicit Binding                  | Lifecycle Type                |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| RestrictedInterceptorContext      | Interceptor                   |
| FullInterceptorContext            | Interceptor (post only)       |
| InterceptorMeta                   | Interceptor                   |
| ReadOnlyReflectHandler            | Interceptor                   |
| ReflectHandler                    | Interceptor                   |
| MiddlewareContext                 | Middleware                    |
| GuardMeta                         | Guard                         |
| GuardContext                      | Guard                         |
| ExceptionCatcherContext           | Exception Catcher             |
| ExceptionCatcherMeta              | Exception Catcher             |
| RouteEntry                        | Exception Catcher             |

:::important
While you can bind the context object itself, it is recommended to scope your needs as much as possible. This can help declare your intent and make your code more readable. Consequently, it can also help you test your code more effectively.

## Register the Lifecycle Component

To register the lifecycle component, annotate your `LifecycleComponent` class on the app, controller, or endpoint level.

```dart title="routes/controllers/my_controller.dart"
import 'package:revali_router/revali_router.dart';

// highlight-next-line
@MyComponent()
@Get('')
Future<void> myEndpoint() {
    ...
}
```

### Register as Type Reference

```dart title="routes/controllers/my_controller.dart"
import 'package:revali_router/revali_router.dart';

// highlight-next-line
@LifecycleComponents([MyComponent])
@Get('')
Future<void> myEndpoint() {
    ...
}
```
