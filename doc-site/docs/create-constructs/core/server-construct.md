# Server Construct

A Server Construct is what generates the server's code. The code generated by a Server Construct is the code that will be executed on the server. This code is responsible for handling requests, processing data, and returning responses.

## Creating a Server Construct

:::tip
Follow the [Getting Started][getting-started] guide to create a new Construct.
:::

To create a Server Construct, you need to set the `is_server` field in the `construct.yaml` file to `true`. This tells Revali that this construct is a Server Construct.

```yaml
constructs:
    - name: my_construct
      is_server: true
      ...
```

:::tip
Read more about [Construct Configuration][construct-config] and the [`is_server`][construct-config-is-server] field.
:::

## Rules

The only rule for a Server Construct is that **it must have a `main` function**. This function is the entry point for Revali's CLI to run, debug, and test the server.
