To work in the NestJS framework at a high level, hereâ€™s what you need to know:

1. Core Concepts
   Modularity: NestJS uses modules as the building blocks of the application. Each module encapsulates a set of related components, such as controllers, services, and providers.
   Decorators: Decorators like @Module(), @Controller(), @Injectable(), and @Get() are used to define and configure components in a declarative way.
   Dependency Injection (DI): NestJS uses DI to manage the lifecycle of components, allowing services to be injected into other classes, promoting loose coupling and reusability.
2. Architecture
   Controllers: Handle incoming requests and return responses to the client. Controllers define routes and route handlers using decorators like @Get(), @Post(), etc.
   Services: Encapsulate business logic and are injected into controllers or other services using DI. They are typically decorated with @Injectable().
   Modules: Group related components into a cohesive block. Every NestJS application has at least one root module.
   Providers: These are classes or values that can be injected into other classes. Services, repositories, and factories can be providers.
3. Routing
   Define routes using decorators in controllers. Routes map HTTP requests to specific handler methods.
   NestJS supports nested routing and route parameters.
4. Middleware
   Middleware functions intercept requests before they reach the controller. They are often used for tasks like logging, authentication, and request modification.
5. Guards
   Guards are used to implement authorization logic. They determine whether a request should be processed based on conditions like user roles or permissions.
6. Interceptors
   Interceptors allow you to transform or manipulate requests and responses globally or per controller/action basis. They can be used for logging, caching, or modifying responses.
7. Pipes
   Pipes are used for validation and transformation of data before it reaches the route handler. They can transform request payloads or validate incoming data against schemas.
8. Filters
   Exception filters handle errors thrown in the application and format the response. They catch exceptions and return custom error messages or status codes.
9. Custom Decorators
   You can create custom decorators to encapsulate common logic or metadata that can be reused across controllers and services.
10. Database Integration
    ORM Support: NestJS integrates with ORMs like TypeORM, Sequelize, and Mongoose for working with SQL and NoSQL databases.
    Repositories: Used to interact with the database, typically through TypeORM or Mongoose models.
11. Asynchronous Programming
    NestJS is built on top of Node.js, so it uses asynchronous programming patterns. Promises and async/await are commonly used.
    Supports microservices and WebSockets for building real-time applications.
12. Testing
    Built-in testing utilities for unit testing (using Jest by default). Supports dependency injection in tests to easily mock services and components.
13. CLI
    The NestJS CLI is used to scaffold, build, and manage applications. It can generate modules, controllers, services, and more with simple commands.
14. Extensibility
    NestJS is highly extensible, allowing you to integrate with other libraries or frameworks. You can create custom modules, use third-party middleware, or extend built-in functionality.
15. Microservices
    NestJS has built-in support for building microservices, allowing you to create modular, loosely coupled services that can communicate over various transport layers like TCP, Redis, or gRPC.
16. GraphQL Support
    NestJS has integrated support for GraphQL, allowing you to build APIs with a GraphQL schema and resolvers alongside REST endpoints.
17. Deployment
    NestJS applications can be deployed on any platform that supports Node.js. You can deploy using traditional hosting services, containers, or serverless platforms.
    Understanding these concepts will give you a solid foundation for developing applications with NestJS, enabling you to build scalable, maintainable, and well-structured applications.

You said:
What would be the exact lifecycle of a NestJS framework? For example, provide me something like:

1. Interceptor.pre
2. Middlewares
3. Interceptor.post

but with the actual lifecycle broken down like this

In NestJS, the lifecycle of handling an HTTP request can be broken down into the following sequence:

Global Middlewares:

Middleware: These functions are executed first, before the route is matched. They can modify the request, response, or end the request-response cycle early. Middleware is typically used for logging, authentication, and request validation.
Guards:

Guard Execution: Guards are executed after middleware and before the route handler. They determine whether the request should be processed based on custom logic, such as user roles or permissions. If a guard returns false, the request is denied, and the response is sent immediately.
Interceptors (Pre-handler):

Pre-handler Interceptors: Interceptors are executed before the actual route handler. They can modify the request, transform data, or handle cross-cutting concerns like logging and caching. They are executed in the order they are applied, allowing multiple interceptors to be chained.
Pipes:

Parameter Transformation/Validation: Pipes are executed after interceptors and before the route handler. They are used to transform or validate the incoming request data. Pipes can alter the data before it reaches the route handler, ensuring that the data is in the expected format.
Route Handler (Controller):

Controller Method: The actual route handler in the controller is invoked. This is where the business logic of handling the request resides, typically involving services or other dependencies injected into the controller.
Interceptors (Post-handler):

Post-handler Interceptors: After the route handler has processed the request and generated a response, post-handler interceptors are executed. They can modify the response or add additional processing, such as wrapping the response in a specific format.
Exception Filters:

Error Handling: If an exception is thrown during any part of the request lifecycle (guards, interceptors, pipes, or the route handler), the exception filters are invoked. Filters catch and handle exceptions, formatting the error response sent back to the client.
Response Handling:

Final Response: After all processing, including post-handler interceptors, the response is sent back to the client. This is the final step in the lifecycle.
Sequence Summary:
Global Middlewares
Guards
Interceptors (Pre-handler)
Pipes
Route Handler (Controller)
Interceptors (Post-handler)
Exception Filters
Response Handling
This sequence ensures that each component in the NestJS framework has a specific role in processing and managing the lifecycle of an HTTP request, from the moment it enters the system to when the response is sent back to the client.
