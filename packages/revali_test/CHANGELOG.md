# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0 | 08.13.26

### Features

- `TestHeaders.add` appends instead of overwriting, matching `dart:io`. A response setting several cookies — each needing its own `Set-Cookie` line — arrived with only the last one, so tests could not see the rest.
- `TestRequest` sends binary and streamed bodies as they are. Previously anything that was not a `String` was `jsonEncode`d, so a `List<int>` upload arrived as the *text* `"[1,2,3]"`, and a `Stream` body was read as WebSocket frames rather than a request body — leaving the request empty. WebSocket input now arrives through its own `webSocketInput` parameter, so a streamed HTTP body is expressible at all.
- First release. `revali_test` was previously `publish_to: none`, so the testing helpers the docs and the internal suite rely on were unavailable to anyone outside this repo. It exposes `TestServer`, which stands in for an `HttpServer` so a generated server runs in-process without binding a socket, plus `TestRequest`/`TestResponse`/`TestHeaders` and the `expectRecentHttpDate` matcher.
