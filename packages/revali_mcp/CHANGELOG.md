# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0 | 08.13.26

### Features

- First release. `revali_mcp` was previously `publish_to: none`, so the Cursor configuration in the repo README could not resolve for anyone outside this repo. Exposes `list_routes`, `get_route`, `doctor`, `recent_requests`, and `create_scaffold` over an MCP stdio server.

### Fixes

- Frame stdio messages by byte count rather than decoded character count. `Content-Length` counts bytes, so any message body containing a non-ASCII character left the server waiting on data that had already arrived, and it never replied. Responses are likewise written as UTF-8 bytes instead of through `stdout.write`, which re-encodes using `Stdout.encoding` and could disagree with the length already announced.
