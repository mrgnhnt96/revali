# CHANGELOG

## 1.2.0 | 08.13.26

### Fixes

- Emit the spec deterministically. Paths, the operations within each path, and component schemas were written in whatever order the filesystem walk discovered controllers, so the same project produced `/complex` first on macOS and `/users` first on Linux. A spec that reorders itself per platform cannot be diffed, committed, or compared against a golden. All three are now sorted.

- Depend on `revali_annotations ^3.0.0` (previously `revali_router_annotations ^2.2.0`). The router/annotations consolidation refactor already dropped this dependency in source, but the package version was never bumped, so pub.dev's 1.0.0 stayed pinned to `revali_router_annotations`, which pulls in `revali_router_core ^2.3.0` -> `revali_core ^1.6.0`, conflicting with `revali ^3.0.0`'s `revali_core ^2.0.0` requirement.
